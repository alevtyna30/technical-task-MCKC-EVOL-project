# Description

A simple calculator application that supports basic arithmetic operations: 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

This calculator uses BigDecimal to prevent errors when multiplying two large numbers, 
and it allows users to specify the scale of the result through the constructor of the SimpleCalculator class.
The scale determines the number of decimal places in the result.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
